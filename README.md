# Word-Guess-Game

This is a hangman game. It looks very simple to the user, but I challenged myself by using very complex logic in the form of functional programming. I also used this as an opportunity to test out JavaScript's Maps. The
reason I ended up using Maps was because they guarantee the order of keys (I had an issue we a key being dependent on another key). There is a lot of remaining refactoring, code cleanup, and comments I was going to add. That's all for now --I hope you enjoy my game!

note about game timer: I was going to implement a countdown and difficulty mode. I decided against this to save time for working on other projects. Feel free to implement one and send a pull request.
